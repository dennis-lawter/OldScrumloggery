OldScrumloggery
===============

The old Scrumloggery web application, which I plan to remake with better coding practices.

Scrumloggery is a scrum backlog application.  It allows users to sign in and modify a product backlog, tiered using the scrum heirarchy of tasks. 

Since I began work on this project, I've grown and come to learn much about PHP frameworks and template engines.  Using an all new approach, along with the niceties of PHP5, I plan to recreate this project from the ground-up as an open-source project from day one.
